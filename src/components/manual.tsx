  Introduction: `Welcome to the AO User Manual! Here you will find a comprehensive guide to all of the AO's functions and many of its possible uses.

The AO (ao-react project) is currently at version 0.7.0.

This user manual is currently at version 0.7.0

There are currently two bugs in this manual. The manual is customized for the language on each server, and this is done with word replacement. This may lose some capital letters and replace some non-whole-words.`,
  Overview: {
    index: `The AO is a free software project and a lived practice of creating open-source software for a peer-to-peer community.`,
    "What's it For?": `There are many reasons you might set up an AO server. Here are some of the types of community projects the AO was specifically designed to support:

### Local Hackerspace

The AO was originally created to help a local hackerspace manage its membership dues, door security, sidewalk LED art, and bitcoin soda machine.

### Chore Rota

For a household or a local community center, the AO can be used to help organize chores and other maintenance tasks for the community. The points and bounty system in the AO make it easy to create and distribute either real or made-up local points amongst various projects and goals, and people who complete those tasks can claim the points on them.

### Hardware Automation / IOT

Hardware devices can be connected to the AO over a local network and controlled through customizeable panels. Custom scripts for each device can be triggered by the AO to allow virtually any device to be connected and controlled or automated. AO users have created dancing LED sidewalk art installations, security doors, and bitcoin-activated vending machines, with plans for autonomous lockers and other useful devices.

### Online Image Board

In addition to local communities, the AO is also designed to support online-only communities. Since digital communities are ultimately grounded in the media they exchange, the AO comes with drag-and-drop file sharing and the ability to automatically sync file attachments over tor between two paired AO servers.

### Virtual Rooms

The AO is also a good place to hang out online in real time. Each group can have a chatroom added to it, making it easy to create new secure virtual rooms.

### Online Classes

For online schools and freelance teachers, the AO makes it easy to organize a group as a class, assign roles (levels) to members of a classroom, and share cards in the dropbox that can only be accessed by members of that level.

### News Syndication

The AO's peer-to-peer tor synchronization feature makes it trivial to syndicate news through multiple hops across the network. By networking our AO servers together, we can build a powerful decentralized news network.

### Personal Wiki

The cards on the AO are designed to make it easy to capture ideas at any time, and keep these ideas as organized as possible with the minimum number of actions. Cards can be placed inside each other, and one card can appear in multiple locations. Search uses regular expressions to provide powerful and industry-standard access to cards.

### Getting Things Done

The AO has been designed with a powerful productivity workflow that focuses on doing and completing tasks, not endless planning. An exciting feature called the Hopper allows you to hop automatically between your bookmarks every X to Y minutes, optionally sending you a Signal notification. This lets you get a bird's eye view of all your tasks or receive randomized reminders or affirmations throughout your day. The AO has also been designed with David Allen's GTD system in mind.

### Political Campaigns

For activists or decentralist politicians, the AO has been designed as the ultimate specialized tool for decentralized community organizers and canvassers-for-the-people. The AO will help you to get a top-level view, recruit, communicate, plan timelines (with grids), build knowledge bases, and track checklists.

### Email Replacement (planned feature)

Send cards to other members on the same server, or sync cards securely over tor. Future updates will allow the AO to act as a public (or members-only) website where people can go to send you messages. Also under consideration is transitional full email server integration (incoming emails will arrive as cards—a sender approved list or Captcha will stop spam before it starts).

### Independent Content Publishing (planned feature)

For content creators, the AO will make it easy to publish your content publicly or for members-only, and collect donations or required monthly dues from members. Why use YouTube when you can host your own content and provide your viewers a customizable and intimate free or membership experience?`,
    'Getting Started': `Someone else will need to create an account for you and tell you the URL, username and password so you can log in. Visit the URL and type the username and password and press Enter to log in. There is a bug right now so you will also need to refresh the page after login.`,

    'The Community Hub Card': `There is a reserved card with the text 'community hub' on each server. Click the icon in the top-left corner of the screen to visit this card. Having one card as a shared starting-place for everyone makes it much easier to start sharing cards, memes, and news in smaller communities. The other way to share stuff within a server is guilds.`,

However, if you install the AO on your laptop or on a server, you can add files directly to the AO by putting them in the AO's memes folder. The default location of this folder is ~/.ao/memes/. Simply copy or move files here and restart the AO, and the files will be scanned and a card made for each file. These cards are not held by anyone right now, so you must search for them and grab them to find them. Future updates will also add live scanning and full iTunes-like file organization features, so that your folders of memes on your hard drive can be kept in lockstep with the structure of your cards on the AO.",
    'Snapshot backups':
      'In its database, the AO uses a log of events from the beginning of time to reconstruct the current state of affairs every time it starts up. The AO can also make snapshots of the state of affairs at a particular point in time and load from one of these images when it starts up. Currently, the recommended normal operation of the AO is to set the AO to automatically make these snapshots once per day, and to always load from the most recent snapshot. When a snapshot is created, in theory, all of the events preceding that snapshot could be safely deleted, as the AO will always be able to load from the snapshot. However, this is not yet recommended, because the AO is not yet fully stable, and if you run into any issues with your snapshots, you can always just reconstruct from the beginning of time. Later, we may set it to automatically delete the old events, which will allow the AO to fully forget deleted cards and members. Currently, traces still remain in the database and are accessible to admins (or an attacker).',
    Security:
      'The AO has not been adequately secured, tested or vetted and is not secure. It is not recommended to use the AO for storing private information. However, the AO has been made with modern web technologies in a fairly standard way, so in theory it should be "secure by default" to most common attacks.',

    Roadmap: `Here is a roadmap of the next few versions of the AO:
* AO version 0.8.0 will bring back bitcoin and lightning integration.

* AO version 0.9.0 will finalize task completion, timeclock, and bounty features.

* AO version 1.0 Alpha will finalize all existing features and freeze the feature set for the 1.0 release.the

* AO version 1.0 Beta will polish all features and fix all bugs

* AO version 1.0, codename "Shrigma", will be complete

* AO version 1.1 will add important convenience features such as the ability for end-users to export their cards for download, sound effects, and better theming.`,
